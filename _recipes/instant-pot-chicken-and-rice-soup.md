## Ingredients
- 2 teaspoon olive oil
- 1/2 yellow onion, chopped
- 1 large carrot, cut into thin half-circles
- 1 large stalk celery, diced
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 3/4 dried rosemary, crushed
- 5 cups low sodium chicken broth
- 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast
- 3/4 cup brown rice, uncooked
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1/4 cup flat leaf parsley, minced (optional)
- Salt & Pepper

## Steps
1. Set the Instant Pot to Saute mode. Heat the olive oil, then add the onion, carrot and celery. Saute the vegetables, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften, 3 to 4 minutes.

2. Add the garlic, thyme and rosemary. Cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds.

3. Pour in the chicken broth and stir to combine.

4. Add the chicken breasts, brown rice, salt and pepper to the Instant Pot.

5. Put the lid on the Instant Pot, close the steam vent and set to HIGH pressure using the manual setting. Set the time to 13 minutes. It will take the Instant Pot about 15 minutes to reach pressure.

6. Once the time is expired, use natural release for 10 minutes, then quick release.

7. Transfer the chicken breasts to a cutting board, shred with 2 forks, then transfer back to the Instant Pot. Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve.

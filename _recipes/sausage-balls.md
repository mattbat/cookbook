# Sausage Balls

![Image of Sausage Balls](../img/sausage-balls.jpeg)

## Ingredients
- 1 lb ground sausage
- 4 cups mild cheddar cheese
- 2 3/4 to 3 cups Bisquick


## Steps
1. Mix ingredients together. (you will probably have some Bisquick and cheese left over) and roll into balls and put on a cookie sheet.
2. Bake in oven 10-12 minutes at 425ÂºF. A little longer if frozen or you want them crispier.

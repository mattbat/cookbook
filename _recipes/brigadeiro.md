## Ingredients
- 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa
- 1 tablespoon butter

## Steps
1. Gather all ingredients.
2. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the condensed milk, cocoa, and butter.
3. Cook and stir the mixture until it thickens, about 10 minutes.
4. Remove from heat and let the mixture cool until it is cool enough to handle.
5. Use your hands to shape the mixture into small balls and place them on a serving plate.
6. Serve immediately or chill until ready to serve.

## Notes
Brigadeiro can also be made in the microwave; just remember to stir every minute.

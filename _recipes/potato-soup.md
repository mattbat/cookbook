## Ingredients
- 2 1/2 pounds diced red potatoes
- 1/2 pound bacon
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 1 small stalk celery, diced
- 4 cups milk
- 4 cups water
- 1/3 cup chicken base
- 1/2 cup butter
- 1/2 cup flour

- 1 teaspoon pepper
- 1/4 cup chopped parsley

## Steps
1. Steam or boil the diced potatoes until they are tender (about 10 minutes). Set aside.
2. In a soup pot, cook the bacon until crisp.
3. Add the diced onions and celery to the pot. Cook on medium-high heat until the celery is tender and the bacon is crisp.
4. Pour in the milk, water, and chicken base. Heat the mixture until it reaches 180Â°F.
5. In a separate pan, create a roux by melting the butter and adding the flour. Mix well and cook for one minute.
6. Add the roux to the soup pot, stirring until the soup thickens.
7. Stir in the salt, pepper, parsley, heavy cream, and the cooked potatoes.
8. Ladle the soup into bowls and top with bacon, scallions, and shredded cheddar cheese.

This creamy chowder is perfect for a cold day, serving up hearty flavors that will warm you from the inside out. Enjoy it straight from the pot!

## Notes  
once upon a time my wife tracy and I went to visit my grandchildren. we went to the store and got peppers and herbs. So we made salsa it was a little spicy but my older grandchild could take it. He said it "wasn't spicy" but I knew he thought it was spicy. the end. p.s. it is called the m.m.s for short.

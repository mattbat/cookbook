# Instant Pot Broccoli Cheddar Soup

![Image of Instant Pot Broccoli Cheddar Soup](../img/instant-pot-broccoli-cheddar-soup.jpeg)

## Ingredients
- 1 Tbsp butter
- 1 medium yellow onion, diced
- 2 or 3 celery ribs, diced
- 2 or 3 carrots, matchstick style, grated, or diced
- 4 cups coarsely chopped fresh broccoli florets
- 3 cups chicken broth (or 3 cups of water and 3 tsp of Better than Bouillon Chicken Base)
- 1/4 cup butter
- 1/4 cup flour
- 2 cups milk
- 1 (8 oz) block of sharp cheddar, grated
- 1/2 tsp salt
- Freshly ground pepper, to taste
- Optional: cornstarch and water for thickening

## Steps
1. Turn your Instant Pot to the sauté function and melt 1 Tbsp of butter. Add diced onion and sauté for 3 minutes.
2. Add celery, carrots, broccoli, and chicken broth. Cover the Instant Pot and lock the lid, ensuring the valve is on “sealing.” Set to pressure cook on high for 1 minute.
3. While the pot heats up, melt 1/4 cup butter in the microwave or on the stove. Slowly whisk in flour until a creamy mixture forms. Set aside. (Optionally, heat the milk to speed up the process.) Grate the cheddar and set aside.
4. When cooking time is up, let the pot naturally release pressure for 5 minutes, then move the valve to “venting.” Carefully remove the lid.
5. Turn the Instant Pot back to sauté. Whisk 1 cup of the broth from the soup into the butter and flour mixture, then add this back into the pot, stirring until the soup thickens.
6. Stir in the milk until heated through, then add the cheese, stirring until melted. Season with salt and pepper. For a thicker soup, mix 2 Tbsp cornstarch with 2 Tbsp cold water and stir into the soup.
7. Ladle into bowls and serve. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. (Freezing may work well, though not tested.)

## Notes
This recipe is reminiscent of Panera Bread’s broccoli cheddar soup, but even creamier and richer!
